Discussions: (Should there be another section containing the discussions?)
 - Does scaling the power spectrum matter?
 - Use of PCA before t-SNE
 - Using watershed+gaussian blur as a clustering method, as opposed to other clustering methods
 - How does the noise affect the data?
 - Alternatives to the simple downsampling
 - Positive effects of downsampling for t-SNE. Gets rid of the time series effect which creates lines in the embedding.


Plots of simulated data:
 - Plot one of the time series in a short interval with the different behaviours color coded.
 - Plot the scaleogram for the same period
 - PCA 2D, t-SNE, t-SNE + PCA, t-SNE + PCA no undersampling

 - What role does Bartul Mimica have?
 - LaTeX template? Citations?
 - Why are all points assigned to a behaviour? 
 At times the rats are just running around (I thought this is part of the assumptions).
 - Detrendingâ€”why do we do it here, are there trends in the different movements?
 - What is z-scoring? Standardization? Dividing by the covariance is commented ouyt in the code
 Also the z-scoring is done before the detrending in the code, but in the text it is mentioned after.
 - How in depth do I go on the subjects? I.e., to describe detrending and wavelet decomposition do I need to treat time series in general?
 - Should I include definitions and theorems?
